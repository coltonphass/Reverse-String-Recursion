# Recursive String Reversal (C++)

This C++ program demonstrates how to **reverse a string using recursion**. It reads a C-style string (character array), reverses it in-place, and displays the result.

This is a great example of:
- Basic recursion
- String manipulation with character arrays
- Working with pointers in C-style strings

---

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è How It Works

1. The program initializes a character array with the string:
   ```
   Hello, my name is recursion.
   ```

2. It then displays the original string.

3. A recursive function `ReverseStringRecursive()` is called to reverse the string **in-place**.

4. The reversed string is then printed.

## üîÅ Recursive Logic Explained

The `ReverseStringRecursive(char* str)` function works by:
- Finding the length of the string
- Swapping the first and last characters
- Temporarily modifying the string to isolate the substring
- Making a **recursive call** on the inner substring
- Restoring the original structure after recursion
